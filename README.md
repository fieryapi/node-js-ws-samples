## Sample Node.js Program To Demonstrate How To Receive Fiery Events

Setup the modules in `src` directory with `npm install`, modify `fiery_events.js` in the configuration section to connect to the Fiery then execute the script with `npm start`.

The sample program runs three scenarios:

  * Receive only Fiery status change events
  * Receive only job is printing? events
  * Receive only job is printing? events in batch mode

If you want to move to the next scenario, simply press `enter` key

**Note** Always use secure connection (HTTPS) when connecting to Fiery API in production.
